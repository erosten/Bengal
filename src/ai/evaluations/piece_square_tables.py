# Below are the PST values which work best for rofchade. As you can see very asymmetric. They are defined as if looking to the board from white (so I can understand them better..). The first square in the table [0] is square A8 and the last square [63] is H1. This means that it can be used directly for black, for white you have flip it vertically so you cant take the square XOR 56 for white.
# So if you want to calculate the MG PST value of a rook on square 'sq', if the rook is WHITE you take value pieceSquareScore[MG][ROOK][sq ^ 56], if the rook is BLACK you take pieceSquareScore[MG][ROOK][sq].
